## Installation

Install Zephyr and Zephyr SDK and set the environment variable `ZEPHYR_BASE` to the path of the Zephyr SDK.

[zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)

Note: make sure to run until post install of the SDK. [zephyr sdk install](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-the-zephyr-sdk)

Install Nordic SDK and follow setup

[nordic sdk](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-fundamentals/lessons/lesson-1-nrf-connect-sdk-introduction/)

Note, after installing make sure to close all instances of IDE and re-open to get new environment variables.

!Important: set the environment variable ZEPHYR_BASE to %HOMEPATH%\zephyrproject\zephyr or the path to the zephyr SDK, NOT the zephyrproject.
